        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        <p>
          hi, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I was born and raised
          in Saint Paul, Minnesota. There, I grew up with my younger brother and
          my parents. I attended Yinghua Academy Chinese Immersion for K-8th
          grade, where I not only learned to speak, write, and read Mandarin,
          but also found an appreciation of my Chinese heritage. From there, I
          went to Roseville Area High School, in Roseville, MN. I continued
          playing soccer for my club and school, and during my junior year I
          decided to take AP Computer Science Principles. I had an amazing
          teacher, Mr. B, who taught me the basics of programming and computer
          science. This inspired me to pursue a degree in cs, and I began
          applying to universities with this in mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          I applied to Gonzaga University after hearing about them from March
          Madness (yes really), and I was accepted with a degree path of b.s. in
          cs. In my first year, I took all the required Gonzaga courses, cs
          included. I didn't know how I liked it at first. The first semester of
          college was a big adjustment for me, and this adjustment honestly
          continued on into my second semester. I was just coding to get my
          homework done. Besides all that, I had a great time at Gonzaga. I met
          a lot of people from all over the country, and continued to play
          soccer for fun + go zagsmbb üèÄ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sophomore year was better, one group project in particular. I worked
          with a team of 3 other students to build a replica of Yahtzee, and it
          was a very different experience from any other class at Gonzaga thus
          far. I learned a lot about working with others and different team
          dynamics. It was a good experience learning to build something
          alongside a team, and it reminded me why I was studying cs in the
          first place.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Now we're here!</h2>
        <p>
          Moving into junior year, life was moving fast. The pressure was
          starting to build, but I kept my head and continued with my studies.
          One of my courses, database management, unintentionally helped me
          discover something that I am genuinely passionate about in the world
          of cs.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the course final project, we built a fullstack application that
          had to involve querying some sort of SQL database. I used React to
          build my frontend, and it was my first time using a tool like react. I
          started with a Youtube tutorial, and then tailored it to meet the
          needs of my course project. I thought React was super cool, so I
          wanted to continue using tools similar to it to get a better
          understanding of how to create frontends.
        </p>

        <p>
          The summer before senior year, I travelled with my family to my mom's
          home country, Singapore. From there, we went to Nepal, where we stayed
          in Kathmandu and Pokhara for a few weeks. It was an amazing
          experience, and I saw so many beautiful things. It inspired me to pay
          attention to detail more, which has been very helpful. Now, I'm
          entering my final semester at Gonzaga, and I'm really happy with how
          this project turned out. I'm working on the frontend for my senior
          capstone project as well, also using a javascript framework. Using
          tools like these has been super enjoyable, it's so fun to see what
          combinations of different libariries and plugins you can use to be as
          creative as you want. I have learned a lot the past few years, and I'm
          excited to see where life takes me next! ‚≠ê
